I am an evolutionary anthropologist interested in understanding how nonhuman primates solve social challenges. To do this, I analyze observations of social behavior from uncontrolled wild environments. My empirical work focuses on the behavior of white-faced capuchin monkeys (*Cebus capucinus*) from the [Lomas Barbudal Monkey Project](https://lbmp.anthro.ucla.edu/ "Lomas Barbudal Monkey Project"). I investigate whether capuchin monkeys reciprocate help, [what social information they use to recruit allies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKwibXTyBcs "BEC talk"), and whether capuchins who are more social live longer. My theoretical work focuses on modeling the innovation dynamics in age-structured populations. 


Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher working with [Richard McElreath](https://xcelab.net/rm/ "Richard McElreath") and [Mary Brooke McElreath](https://mbmcelreath.com/ "Mary Brooke McElreath") at the [Department of Human Behavior, Ecology and Culture](https://www.eva.mpg.de/ecology/index.html "HBEC") at the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology](https://www.eva.mpg.de/index.html "MPI EVA"). I earned my PhD at the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.anthro.ucla.edu/ "UCLA Anthropology").
