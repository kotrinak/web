[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am an evolutionary anthropologist interested in understanding how nonhuman primates solve social challenges. To do this, I analyze observations of social behavior from uncontrolled wild environments. My empirical work focuses on the behavior of white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus) from the Lomas Barbudal Monkey Project. I investigate whether capuchin monkeys reciprocate help, what social information they use to recruit allies, and whether capuchins who are more social live longer. My theoretical work focuses on modeling the innovation dynamics in age-structured populations.\nCurrently, I am a postdoctoral researcher working with Richard McElreath and Mary Brooke McElreath at the Department of Human Behavior, Ecology and Culture at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. I earned my PhD at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/www.kkotrina.com/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/www.kkotrina.com/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am an evolutionary anthropologist interested in understanding how nonhuman primates solve social challenges.
